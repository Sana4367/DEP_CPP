Text files can be compressed to make them smaller and faster to send, and unzipping files on devices has a 
low overhead. The process of encoding involves changing the representation of a file so that the (binary) 
compressed output takes less space to store and takes less time to transmit while retaining the ability to 
reconstruct the original file exactly from its compressed representation.
